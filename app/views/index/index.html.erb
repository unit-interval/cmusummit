			<h1>Why CMU Summit?</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Over the past few decades, China has successfully transformed itself from a poor society into a modern nation that plays a central role in global issues. China is currently the fastest-growing economy in the world with unmatched annual growth rates, expanding international influence, and growing technological innovation. China has the single largest population of Internet users in the world and more university graduates than ever. With extraordinary capabilities and great potential, China has a bright future ahead.</p>
				<p>Today, the United States continues to fuel global markets and lead in innovation and technology. In the age of globalization and facing world financial crises, the relationship between China and the U.S. will undoubtedly continue to play an essential role in future economic issues. With the future in mind, China will face many challenges emerging from its rapid development; ideas and solutions from both China and the United states would aid and benefit the growth of both countries.</p>
				<p>This April, the CMU Summit is expected to draw more than 1,000 participants to Carnegie Mellon University. Entrepreneurs, executives and venture capitalists from China and the U.S. will come together to discuss China’s growing influence on the global economy. The Summit will explore the United States’ role and how it will present mutual opportunities for both nations in the years to come.</p>
